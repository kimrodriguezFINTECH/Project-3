# Self Generate Event NFT for Sale with Tokenization
## Background
Event management has always been a complex and multi-faceted industry, involving numerous stakeholders, significant logistical challenges, and various layers of security and verification. Traditional methods of ticketing often face problems such as fraud, counterfeiting, and unauthorized reselling, which can significantly impact the experience of event organizers and attendees alike.
* Fraud and Counterfeiting: Ticket fraud is a significant issue, with consumers losing millions of dollars annually to counterfeit tickets. A report from Verified.org explains how scammers often sell fake tickets to high-demand events, leaving buyers without access and out of pocket [1].
* Unauthorized Reselling: Unauthorized ticket reselling (scalping) leads to significant losses for both event organizers and consumers. This problem is highlighted by IdentityIQ, which notes that ticket scams are prevalent for sold-out events due to high demand [2].
With the advent of blockchain technology, there is a unique opportunity to revolutionize the event ticketing process. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) provide a secure, transparent, and immutable way to represent ownership of digital assets. By leveraging NFTs for event tickets, we can address many of the longstanding issues in the ticketing industry.
## Objective
1. Eliminate Fraud and Counterfeiting: Traditional paper or digital tickets are susceptible to fraud and counterfeiting. NFTs, being unique and verifiable on the blockchain, can ensure that each ticket is authentic and tamper-proof. According to Forbes, blockchain's immutability and transparency significantly reduce fraud in ticketing [3].
2. Prevent Unauthorized Reselling: NFT-based tickets can include smart contract rules that restrict or control the resale of tickets. This can prevent scalping and ensure tickets are sold at fair prices. TechCrunch discusses how smart contracts can enforce resale rules automatically, making them ideal for this purpose [4].
3. Enhance Attendee Experience: NFT tickets can offer a richer experience by including additional digital content, such as event memorabilia, exclusive access, or future benefits, all embedded within the NFT. CoinDesk highlights various case studies where NFTs have enhanced fan engagement in sports and entertainment [5].
4. Empower Event Organizers: By decentralizing the ticketing process, event organizers have greater control over the distribution and pricing of tickets, reducing dependency on third-party vendors and increasing their revenue potential. Harvard Business Review elaborates on the benefits of decentralization in ticketing [6].

## Hypothesis 
We believe we can create our own application that can help event organizers create their own event flyer with the time date and location of the even with the help of AI technology. Our application will give the event creator full control of the number of tickets that will be sold including the option of buying and selling the ticket amongst other customers.

## Process of Deploying 
## Install Packages
* `os` for interacting with the operating system.
* `streamlit` for connecting to web applications
* `json` for transmitting data in web applications 
* `requests` for interacting with web APIs
* `openai` for accessing and integrating AI models into our applications.
